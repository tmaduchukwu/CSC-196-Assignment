    <p4><a name = "line">The soprano saxophone is the <strong>smallest and highest pitched</strong> of the four main saxophones.
        It is in the key of <strong>B flat</strong>. The soprano is mainly used for smooth jazz music and dabbles a bit in the classical genre.
        However, it is arguably the least common of the main four. The soprano saxophone is traditionally not seen in concert band settings. I personally enjoy the soprano's bright tone
        and its tendancy to cater to modern music. It's an instrument that exceeds in standing alone and being used for powerful classical solos.</a>

        The alto saxophone, also referred to as the alto sax or simply the alto, is a member of the saxophone family of woodwind instruments 
        invented by Belgian instrument designer Adolphe Sax in the 1840s, and patented in 1846. It is pitched in E♭, and is smaller than the tenor, but larger than the soprano. 
        The alto sax is the most common saxophone and is commonly used in popular music, concert bands, chamber music, solo repertoire, military bands, marching bands, and 
        jazz (such as big bands, jazz combos, swing music). The fingerings of the different saxophones are all the same so a saxophone player can play any type of saxophone.

        The tenor saxophone is a medium-sized member of the saxophone family, a group of instruments invented by Adolphe Sax in the 1840s. The tenor and the alto are the two most commonly used saxophones. 
        The tenor is pitched in the key of B♭ (while the alto is pitched in the key of E♭), and written as a transposing instrument in the treble clef, sounding an octave and a major second lower than the written pitch. 
        Modern tenor saxophones which have a high F♯ key have a range from A♭2 to E5 (concert) and are therefore pitched one octave below the soprano saxophone. 
        People who play the tenor saxophone are known as "tenor saxophonists", "tenor sax players", or "saxophonists".

        The baritone saxophone is a member of the saxophone family of instruments, larger (and lower-pitched) than the tenor saxophone, but smaller (and higher-pitched) than the bass. 
        It is the lowest-pitched saxophone in common use - the bass, contrabass and subcontrabass saxophones are relatively uncommon. Like all saxophones, it is a single-reed instrument. 
        It is commonly used in concert bands, chamber music, military bands, big bands, and jazz combos. It can also be found in other ensembles such as rock bands and marching bands. 
        Modern baritone saxophones are pitched in E♭.
